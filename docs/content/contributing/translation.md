Once you’ve contacted the project owner [GitHub issue](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues) and received permission to proofread your language, you’re ready to go!

Please consider a few things while working on the project:

(1) Maximal accuracy will create the best user experience.

(2) Use your choice of style creatively once your translation met the requirement of picking the most identical match.

(3) It makes sense for the translation to be similarly concise as the original.

(4) Let’s always use the same translations on identical source expressions:

If "selected notes" is "ausgewählte Dateien" in German, you would always translate it using this expression. Exception would be when you grammatically are bound to use an alternative, but keep it simple.

In order to find all the identical expressions, search Crowdin and see all the occurences of one term

Standardize occurrences so that all major expressions are translated consistently.

The term “Note” should definitely have just one matching translation.

(5) For plural please add the appropriate translation each in the corresponding block.

(6) When an expression contains an "&" in front of a word or number, you can add a "&" either, if possible to the same letter in your translation or to any other.

(7) The „%1“ tags need to be written without a space, in LTR languages you can either insert the tags from the original or write them into your translation.
